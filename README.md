Any questions start an issue and we'll get back to you ASAP.


# INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL AND RUN

Clone the file from this repository, then open the folder. Within this folder you will find this README file, a LICENCE file (there for legal purposes, no obligation is held to you to read it), the python file to run Kajan, and an ".sh" file to install the required modules.

You also need Python3 to be installed. Intall this using the "sudo apt-get install python3" command
You then need Pip to be installed. Install this using the "sudo apt-get install python3-pip" command

Your first step after this is to give the ".sh" file executable privileges. Do this by running: "chmod +x modules.sh". 
Then run "./modules.sh" to install the modules required. Any issues with the installation tell me and we'll either troubleshoot just for your system, or if it turns out to be a wider issue, we will change the file to help the rest of the users.
Next ensure that you have enabled microphone and sound permissions on your virtual machine or computer.
Run "python3.py"
Use prolifically as you wish in legal circumstances.
